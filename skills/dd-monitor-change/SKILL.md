description: "Rename, retag, reprioritise, retune, reroute or rewrite the message of a Datadog monitor in The Atlantic org without breaking anything that references it. Use for any monitor edit, alert hygiene ticket, threshold change, synthetics monitor edit, notification routing change, or before removing a span or tag that a monitor might query. Also use when a monitor reads OK and you suspect it is silent rather than healthy."

# Change a Datadog monitor

Every rule here was paid for on the ten Interactive monitors in Sep 2026. The full
evidence lives in `~/code/research/datadog-usage-research.md`; the directive form is in
`~/code/research/datadog-best-practices.md`. Read the best-practices file first.

## Recall

```bash
memorygraph recall --query "datadog monitor <id or name>" --limit 10
```

## 1. Save before-state

Audit Trail is Forbidden on Mike's key and an admin must grant it, so a saved GET is the
only rollback and verification record that will exist.

```bash
curl -s "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/monitor/$ID" -H "DD-API-KEY: $DD_API_KEY" -H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: $DD_APP_KEY" > before-$ID.json
```

## 2. Sweep the four reference surfaces

Renaming is safe because references are by id. **Retagging is the risky one**: a
tag-scoped downtime silently widens or breaks and nothing warns you.

1. Dashboards: `GET /api/v1/dashboard` to list, then GET each; widget contents are only
   in the per-dashboard GET. Check match context, note widgets produce false positives.
2. SLOs: `GET /api/v1/slo`, `type:monitor` with `monitor_ids`. Metric SLOs cannot
   reference a monitor.
3. Composite monitors: `GET /api/v1/monitor`, filter `.type=="composite"`, ids are in
   `.query`.
4. Downtimes: `GET /api/v2/downtime`, read `monitor_identifier.monitor_tags`.

Also evaluate the 7 org notification rules (`GET /api/v2/monitor/notification_rule`):
filters are tags-only, ANDed, and rules ADD recipients to message handles. Removing a
tag can drop a channel; adding one can double-deliver.

## 3. Pick the write path

| Target | Path |
|---|---|
| Metadata only (name, tags, priority, message) | `PUT /api/v1/monitor/{id}` with ONLY those keys. It is a partial update; omit `options` and thresholds survive. |
| Thresholds | Rebuild the ENTIRE `options` object from a fresh GET, then send. `update_datadog_monitor` (MCP) replaces `options` wholesale; passing `{thresholds:{critical:2}}` dropped a warning threshold once. Pass only `query` when thresholds are not changing. |
| Synthetics monitor | Read-only via the monitor API (400 "use Synthetics API"). `PATCH /api/v1/synthetics/tests/{public_id}` with `{"data":[{"op":"add","path":"/options/monitor_priority","value":1}]}`. Name is `[Synthetics] ` + test name; the prefix cannot be removed. |

A `500` with an empty body is a clean no-op: re-GET, confirm, retry. Do not start
repairing fields. Verify on one low-priority monitor first, diff before/after, then
batch.

## 4. Message template

Chosen by Mike after editing three drafts:

```
**<service>** · <env> · P<n> · <signal>
{{#is_alert}} 🚨 <what a player or editor cannot do now> {{/is_alert}}
{{#is_warning}} ⚠️ <same, not-yet-broken> {{/is_warning}}
{{#is_recovery}} ✅ <it is back> {{/is_recovery}}
Links
- 2-4 ABSOLUTE https://app.datadoghq.com links, most specific first, Games Platform dashboard (d2g-xff-4fv) last
<handles, one line, OUTSIDE all conditionals>
```

No `##` headings. No engineering notes about migrations or baselines; those live in
tickets. `is_warning` only where a warning threshold exists. Service name dropped where
it is an adjective ("requests"), kept where it is the subject. Link text says "service"
generically unless the link points at a different service than the header.

Routing for Interactive is handle-based in the message, not the `alert-channel:` tag:
P1/P2 get `@oncall-incident-responders` plus `@slack-The_Atlantic-alerts-interactive`,
P3/P4 the Slack handle only.

## 5. Thresholds

Measure at least 14 days; 7-day maxima ran 36% low. Group by `http.status_class` to
discover which values exist before concluding a query is broken: a status-filtered APM
metric returning no series means the service has none, not that the wildcard failed.
Measure the request floor before accepting a small-denominator argument. State on the
ticket which other ticket would invalidate the baseline.

## 6. Verify from GETs, not write responses

The PUT response shows mid-re-evaluation state. Compare `overall_state` from GETs before
and after. A synthetics message PATCH bumps `check_version` and forces an off-schedule
run, so No Data for a minute or more is correct; confirm on
`/api/v1/synthetics/tests/browser/{id}/results` (the segment is the test TYPE, `api`
returns an empty list rather than an error).

Monitor search grammar: `tag:team:interactive AND priority:p1`. `priority:1` is a parse
error that returns HTTP 200 with `total_count: null`. Assert the count is a number.

## Before removing a span or tag anywhere

Check which monitors query it. `client:false` on games-data killed monitor 315265293
silently: it reads OK forever because there is no data. Green is not healthy.

Where to read options without keys: the Export Monitor button, or
`source:monitor_audit_event` in `search_datadog_events`, which also shows the BEFORE
values.

## Memory and research file

Store the change and any new product behaviour, then append a dated refinement to
`~/code/research/datadog-usage-research.md` (see `research-file-update`).
